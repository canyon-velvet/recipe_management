# The assistant end to end, with nothing stubbed: real Claude replies, and a real import fetched from the web. One
# chat shows each agent: the router answering a cooking question itself, Recommend picking from the user's recipes,
# Import reading a link into a draft, and the router offering to update a preference. Replies differ from run to run,
# so it checks who wrote each one and what it showed, not the wording. It costs Claude calls and depends on the
# recipe site being up, so it only runs when asked:
#
#   LIVE_ASSISTANT=1 bundle exec rspec spec/system/ask_the_assistant_spec.rb

# Add RECORD_VIDEO=1 to also record the README demo. Everything it saves is rolled back with the test database.
